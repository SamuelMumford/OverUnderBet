# OverUnderBet

Code to make bar plots for over/under bets. Needs a chromedriver to run and supporting packages.

Dependencies you will need to install:
(Probably new ones)
selenium: https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html - The base package to open and manage websites
webdriver_manager.chrome: https://pypi.org/project/webdriver-manager/ - Very useful package so the webdriver doesn't break every time Chrome updates
bs4: https://pypi.org/project/bs4/ - Base package to get website data in a readable form
(Probably ones you have)
matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html - plotting library
numpy: https://numpy.org/install/ - It's numpy
(If you don't have it, python is maybe broken)
operator: Should be built in
